# 🧭 NLP for Information Extraction – Complete Learning Roadmap

This roadmap combines **books**, **courses**, and **hands-on tools** to guide your study from beginner to advanced in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, and **Relation Extraction (RE)**.

---

## 🟢 Stage 1: Foundations – Learn the Basics of NLP & IE

**Goal**: Understand what NLP is, and get comfortable with terminology like tokenization, entities, parts of speech, and simple extraction.

### ✅ Study Materials
- 📘 **Book**:
  - *Natural Language Processing with Python* (NLTK Book) – Chapters 1–6  
    [https://www.nltk.org/book/](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
- 🎓 **Courses**:
  - [365 Data Science – Intro to NLP for AI](https://365datascience.com/courses/intro-to-nlp-for-ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - [Analytics Vidhya – Intro to NLP](https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/Intro-to-NLP?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### 🧪 Hands-on
- Use `spaCy`, `nltk`
- Example:
  ```python
  import spacy
  nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
  doc = nlp("Gabriel lives in Brusque and is married to Luiza.")
  for ent in doc.ents:
      print(ent.text, ent.label_)


🟡 Stage 2: Intermediate – Named Entity Recognition (NER) + Rule-Based IE
🎯 Goal: Learn to extract structured information using patterns and improve understanding of entity types and relationships.

📚 Study Materials
📘 Book:

Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky & Martin – Chapters 6–9

🎓 Courses:

Cardinal Education – Intro to NLP (AIT 526)

📺 Tutorial:

SpaCy Rule-Based Matching
👉 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMyYIgIlE9c

🧪 Hands-on Practice
Use spaCy’s Matcher and Dependency Parser

Create patterns like:

"X is married to Y"

"lives at [address]"

Combine POS tagging and dependency analysis to extract entity roles

🟠 Stage 3: Relation Extraction + Coreference Resolution
🎯 Goal: Extract relationships between entities and resolve pronouns to their correct references (e.g., “he”, “she”, “both”).

📚 Study Materials
📘 Book:

Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing by Palash Goyal – Chapters 3–5

🎓 Courses / Resources:

OpenNRE Tutorial (Medium)

Stanford CS224U – Relation Extraction Lecture

AllenNLP Coreference Demo

🧪 Hands-on Practice
Use OpenNRE or HuggingFace to fine-tune relation extractors

Use neuralcoref or AllenNLP for pronoun resolution

Start building a small dataset of text → relations (e.g., subject–relation–object)

🔴 Stage 4: Advanced – Transformers, Custom Models & Knowledge Extraction
🎯 Goal: Build advanced, production-ready IE pipelines using pre-trained language models and fine-tuned models.

📚 Study Materials
📘 Book:

Transformers for Natural Language Processing by Denis Rothman

🎓 Courses:

Coursera – NLP with HuggingFace Transformers

Stanford CS224N – Deep Learning for NLP (YouTube)

🧪 Hands-on Practice
Fine-tune BERT, RoBERTa for NER and RE tasks using HuggingFace

Build IE pipelines using:

spaCy + Prodigy for manual annotation

Snorkel for weak supervision

Output structured results into JSON or knowledge graphs

🧩 Bonus: Real-World Project Ideas
🔎 Extract entities and relationships from contracts: parties, dates, obligations

👥 Resume parser: extract personal info, skills, and locations

🌐 Build a mini search engine based on entities and their relationships
