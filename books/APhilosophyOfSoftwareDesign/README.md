# A Philosophy Of Software Design

## Introduction

- It's all about complexity! Complexity is the thing responsible to limited a
developer to be able add, edit or delete feature from a system. The life time of system will be determinated by how much complexity the developers can deal with.
- This book has two porpuses make clear what is and causes of complexity and elaborate some technicques can help you to control or reduce the complexity.

## the nature of complexity

## working code isn't enough

## modules should be deep

## information hiding

## general purpose modules are deeper

## Different layer, Different abstraction

## pull complexity downwards

## better together or better apart?

## define errors out of existence

## design it twice

## why write comments? The for excuses

## comments should describe things that aren't obvious from the code

## choosing names

## write the comments first

## modifying existing code

## consistency

## code should be obvious

## software trends

## designing for performance

## decide what matters

## conclusion
