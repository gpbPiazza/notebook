Great — preparing in advance is a smart move. For the role of **Senior Backend Engineer (Go / Golang)** at Radity, we’ll break the preparation into **topics you should master** + **sample questions** you should be ready to answer (and discuss). Given the job description, you’ll want strong depth in: Golang, microservices, backend/cloud/architecture, performance/security, and operations. I’ll call out each topic, key areas under it, and some questions you can think through (or practice out loud) to be ready.

---

## 1. Golang (Go) — language & ecosystems

Since the job asks for “3+ years of hands-on Go backend development”, expect questions about Go idioms, concurrency, memory model, standard library, best practices.

**Key areas to be comfortable with:**

* Goroutines, channels, `select`, synchronization primitives (`sync`, `atomic`, `WaitGroup`, etc). ([Medium][1])
* Context package (`context.Context`) for time-outs, cancellations, passing request‐scoped values.
* Interfaces, struct embedding/composition vs classical inheritance.
* Error handling, the new Go error wrapping APIs (`errors.Is`, `errors.As`, etc). ([Medium][1])
* Memory management / garbage collection in Go — what you need to know about allocation, avoiding leaks, how Go runtime works.
* Modules, dependency management (`go mod`), build, packaging.
* Standard library: HTTP, `net/http`, JSON (or encoding), concurrency, I/O, logging.
* Idiomatic Go: small interfaces, keeping code simple, avoiding over-engineering, effective structuring of packages. (See discussion: “they try to use same way as from OOP languages…” ([Reddit][2])
* Go version advancements: e.g., Generics (if you have used them) — many senior level roles ask if you know about them. ([Medium][1])

**Sample questions (Go‐specific):**

1. What is the difference between a Goroutine and an OS thread? How does Go schedule Goroutines?
2. Explain how channels work. When would you use buffered vs unbuffered channel? Can you show a simple pattern like fan-in / fan-out using channels?
3. What is `select` in Go? Give an example where you’d use it.
4. How do you handle cancellation/timeouts in Go? Show how you’d use `context.Context`.
5. Explain how interfaces in Go work. What does it mean that types satisfy interfaces implicitly?
6. What’s the difference between struct embedding and inheritance? How do you use embedding in Go?
7. How does Go’s garbage collector work (at a high level)? What are some things you do to write memory-efficient Go code?
8. What are some anti-patterns you’ve seen in Go code (especially from people coming from heavy OOP languages)?
9. How do you structure a Go project in terms of packages, modules, dependencies? How do you avoid cyclic dependencies?
10. Explain how you’d write unit tests in Go. What about benchmarks or integration tests? How do you test concurrency code?
11. (If you’ve used generics) What are generics in Go (Go 1.18+) and when would you use them?
12. Given a code snippet: (they might present a Go snippet) ask: what is the output / identify a bug (for example closure in loop, channel deadlock, race condition). The Reddit thread mentions these “gotchas”. ([Reddit][2])

---

## 2. Backend systems / Microservices architecture

Since the role states you’ll “design, develop, and scale backend systems … microservices architectures, integrate with external systems”, you must show competence in backend architecture, integration, scaling, reliability.

**Key areas:**

* Microservices fundamentals: service boundaries, decomposition, communication patterns (synchronous vs asynchronous), service discovery, versioning, API design.
* Inter-service communication: REST, gRPC, message queues (Kafka, SQS, etc) — pros/cons.
* Design for scale: load balancing, high availability, partitioning, caching strategies, sharding, eventual consistency (or strong), CAP theorem. ([roadmap.sh][3])
* Data management: relational vs NoSQL, when to pick one, schema evolution, migrations.
* Integration with external systems: APIs, webhooks, third-party services, dealing with latency/failures.
* Event-driven architectures, domain-driven design (DDD) aspects, sagas/compensations for long-lived transactions.
* Service reliability/observability: logging, metrics, tracing (distributed tracing), correlation IDs. ([roadmap.sh][3])
* Versioning of APIs, backward compatibility, handling breaking changes.
* Deployment strategy for microservices: containers, orchestration (Kubernetes), service mesh if applicable.
* Trade-offs: monolith vs microservices, when microservices are “too micro”. ([GitHub][4])

**Sample questions:**

1. How would you design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform, handling orders, payments, inventory, notifications? How do you determine service boundaries?
2. What are the pros and cons of using asynchronous messaging (queue) vs synchronous HTTP calls between services?
3. Describe how you’d handle versioning of a public API used by clients when you need to add a breaking change.
4. What strategies do you use to ensure high availability and fault tolerance in a distributed system (microservices)?
5. What is the CAP theorem? Give examples of systems you know that favor different points (C/A/P).
6. How do you implement distributed tracing / request correlation across microservices?
7. Describe caching strategies for a read-heavy service: where would you put caches, how do you invalidate them?
8. What is eventual consistency? When is it acceptable in your system, and when is it not?
9. How would you deploy a microservice update with zero downtime? What might you do about database schema changes accompanying code changes?
10. Suppose an external system (a third-party API) that you integrate with becomes slow/unresponsive — how would you architect your service to handle that gracefully?
11. What metrics/logs/tracing would you monitor for a backend service in production?
12. How do you decide when to move a monolith to microservices? What warning signs indicate you have gone “too micro”?

---

## 3. Cloud, Networking, Security, Performance & Reliability

The job specifies “Solid understanding of AWS, networking, and application security.” So beyond Go/microservices you’ll likely be asked about cloud infra (especially AWS), networking fundamentals, security practices, performance optimization, reliability engineering.

**Key areas:**

* Cloud services (AWS in particular): compute (EC2, Lambda), containers (ECS/EKS), serverless, storage (S3), databases (RDS/Dynamo/Redshift), networking (VPC, subnets, route tables, security groups), IAM.
* Networking: TCP vs UDP, how HTTP works over TCP/TLS, load balancers (ELB/ALB/NLB), DNS, CDN, latency, connection pools, TLS termination.
* Security: authentication/authorization (OAuth, JWT, API keys), encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest, secrets management, least privilege, secret rotation, data protection, audit logging. SQL injection/other attacks. ([GitHub][4])
* Performance & optimization: profiling, latency vs throughput, capacity planning, resource constraints (CPU, memory, network), scaling strategies (horizontal vs vertical), load testing, minimizing GC pauses, efficient concurrency use.
* Reliability/resilience: observability, error budgets, service level objectives (SLOs)/service level indicators (SLIs), circuit-breaker patterns, retries/backoff, fallback, bulkheads, chaos/DR tests.
* Microservices in cloud: secure service-to-service communication, network isolation, no public access unless needed, zero trust, API gateways.
* Cost optimization: right sizing, reserved/spot instances, auto-scaling, monitoring cost metrics.
* DevOps/CI-CD: building/deploying microservices, blue/green or canary deployments, container registries, infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation).
* Monitoring and logging: centralized logging (CloudWatch, ELK), metrics/alerting (Prometheus, CloudWatch metrics), tracing (X-Ray, OpenTelemetry).

**Sample questions:**

1. On AWS, how do you design the network for a microservices architecture (subnets, security groups, VPC, public vs private)?
2. What’s the difference between an HTTP connection made by a client to your service and an HTTP connection your service makes to another internal service? What networking concepts matter?
3. How would you secure an API you expose to the internet? What about securing internal microservices communication?
4. Explain how TLS termination works at a load balancer in AWS.
5. How do you choose between AWS Lambda vs ECS/EKS for a backend service? What trade-offs do you consider?
6. Describe how you would profile a Go service in production to find performance bottlenecks (CPU, memory, GC, blocking).
7. What patterns do you use to ensure your service gracefully handles failures (e.g., downstream DB or external API fails)?
8. What is a circuit-breaker, bulkhead, retry/backoff, and how do you implement them in a microservices environment?
9. How do you ensure your data is encrypted at rest and in transit in a cloud environment? What AWS services help you?
10. How do you monitor your service reliability? What metrics would you define as SLIs/SLOs?
11. What is a load-balancer type you might use in AWS for backend services, and how do you pick between ALB vs NLB?
12. How do you architect your system for cost efficiency while still meeting performance/resilience requirements?

## 4. Ownership, Code Quality, Collaboration, Remote & Global Team

According to the job, you’ll be working in a remote-first, global team, collaborating with product managers, architects, engineers across the globe. So interviewers will likely assess not only technical skills but also your soft skills, how you handle remote collaboration, code quality, clean code, ownership.

**Key areas:**

* Clean, maintainable code: readability, simplicity, modularity, testing, documentation, code reviews.
* Ownership: how you proactively identify problems, propose improvements, take responsibility for services.
* Communication: especially in remote teams (async communication, time-zones, clear documentation, status updates).
* Cross-border/time-zone collaboration: how you coordinate, hand-off, manage dependencies.
* Learning & growth mindset: staying current, mentoring others, improving practices.
* Working in fast-paced environments: agile, iterative releases, dealing with changing requirements.
* Quality assurance: testing strategy (unit, integration, end-to-end), CI/CD, monitoring, regression.
* Handling ambiguity: when tasks are not fully specified, you ask clarifying questions, propose solutions.

**Sample questions:**

1. Describe a time where you took ownership of a system or service, identified a failure or improvement opportunity, and drove change.
2. How do you ensure code you write is maintainable, especially when other engineers will work on it in the future?
3. When you’re part of a remote team across time zones, how do you ensure good communication and collaboration?
4. What’s your approach to code reviews? How do you give feedback; how do you receive feedback?
5. In a microservices environment, how do you ensure consistency in coding standards, logging/monitoring across services when there are multiple teams?
6. How do you stay up-to-date with backend/Go/cloud technologies? How do you grow your skill set?
7. How do you deal with ambiguous or incomplete requirements? What do you ask, what do you assume, how do you manage risk?
8. Give an example of a time when you made a mistake in production. How did you respond? What did you learn?
9. How do you balance delivering quickly and maintaining high quality?
10. How do you mentor junior engineers or help raise the technical bar in your team?

## 5. Putting it all together: Systems design + hands-on coding

For a senior backend engineer role you’ll likely have both a design discussion (architectural) and a coding exercise (maybe Go-specific). They may ask you to design a backend service (or extension) or ask you to code a medium complexity problem in Go (not necessarily algorithm heavy, but practical). From what candidates reported: code challenge with Go backend, API design, concurrency patterns, runtime internals. ([Glassdoor][5])

**Preparation tips:**

* Practice designing systems: think end-to-end – API endpoints, data model, service boundaries, scaling, failures.
* Practice coding in Go: implement small services or microservices: HTTP endpoint + DB + concurrency + context cancellation + tests.
* Revisit concurrency bugs: deadlocks, race conditions, channel misuse, closure in loops.
* Time yourself for a coding task: you might get 45-60 minutes. Focus on readability, correctness, testability.
* On architecture questions: think aloud, ask clarifying questions, show trade-offs.

**Sample combined questions:**

1. Design a service in Go that ingests events from a queue, does some processing, writes to a database, and exposes an API for querying results. What would your architecture look like? How would you ensure scalability, fault tolerance, monitoring?
2. Write a Go function that starts N workers (goroutines) processing tasks from a channel, and returns early if any worker fails. Show how you’d cancel remaining workers and clean up.
3. Suppose you have a legacy monolith service and you need to extract a microservice from it. How would you approach this extraction? What steps do you take?
4. Your Go HTTP service is seeing high latency spikes when GC kicks in. What do you check? How do you optimize it?
5. You have two microservices: A and B. A calls B synchronously for each user request. B sometimes takes up to 2 seconds to respond and causes request timeouts in A. What options do you have to solve this?
6. Your system runs on AWS. You notice CPU usage is high and requests are queued. What metrics do you check? How do you scale the service? What if scaling horizontally isn’t enough?
7. You need to design an authentication/authorization mechanism for your backend APIs. How do you design it? How do you integrate with microservices?
8. Suppose a service you manage has been hit with an unexpected traffic spike (5× normal). What steps do you take to mitigate the impact? What design could you have built in advance to reduce risk?
9. Provide an example of how you used observability (logs/metrics/tracing) to debug a production issue in a microservices environment.
10. How do you ensure different services (built by different teams) adhere to security best practices, performance standards, and consistent error handling?

---

## 6. Specific to Radity’s context

* Remote-first: emphasise your self-organisation, independence, clear communication, working across time zones.
* They highlight “fast-paced tech environments”, “modern cloud technologies”, “you’ll contribute to technical decisions” — so be ready to talk about decisions you made, trade-offs you chose, and how you influenced architecture & design.
* Since you’ll work globally: mention any experience working internationally/remote, asynchronous communication, cross-cultural collaboration.
* Show you’re excited about growth: certifications, learning new things (perhaps Go updates, cloud services), passion for clean code and quality.

---

## 7. Interview logistics & what to expect

From their HR note:

> “The upcoming evaluation will likely focus on core engineering topics such as security, networking, cloud, and of course Golang.”

So you can expect sections in the interview roughly like:

* Discussion of your previous Go/backend work (walkthrough of systems you built)
* Technical questions: Go language + backend systems + cloud + networking + security
* Possibly a coding exercise (Go backend code)
* System/architecture design discussion
* Behavioral/ownership questions: remote work, collaboration, quality, growth
